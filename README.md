=======================

You want a rainbow on your Corsair RGB keyboard? Of course you do! Just download, launch, and modify the rainbow to your liking.

This application is only available for Windows x86.

READ THIS FIRST
===============

Make sure to disable lighting on CUE before using this program!

Having CUE and True Rainbow running simultaneously could overload your keyboard, causing the lights to freeze.

If your keyboard becomes overloaded, either unplug and replug the keyboard OR set your keyboard to BIOS mode on the back of the keyboard and switch back to your original setting.
